# Network Programming

![alt text](Assets/Images/NetworkProgrammingScreenshot.png "NetworkProgrammingScreenshot")

## Description:
Project made for a Network Programming Course. It uses Unity and the Photon package, 
and its aim is to try different techniques to synchronize two game scenes with a lot of game objects,
and reduce the amount of data sent over the network.
Our choice is the Snapshot Interpolation, that sends a compressed representation 
of the scene, which is used by the receiver to recreate a local version of what's going on.
